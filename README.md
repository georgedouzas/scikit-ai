## Introduction

A Reinforcement Learning library that implements a range of classical, deep, and LLM-based RL algorithms. 

It mimics the simplicity of [scikit-learn's](https://scikit-learn.org/) API and integrates with the
[Tianshou](https://tianshou.org/en/stable/) RL library. It also leverages
[textgrad](https://github.com/huggingface/textgrad), [DSPy](https://github.com/darkprinx/dspy), and
[DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) to support the implementation LLM-based agent development.

## Installation

For user installation, `brainblocks` is currently available on the PyPi's repository, and you can
install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install brainblocks
```

Development installation requires to clone the repository and then use [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to install the
project as well as the main and development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrainBlocksAI/brainblocks.git
cd brainblocks
pdm install
```
